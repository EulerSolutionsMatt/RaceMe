Google Cloud Platform Free Tier
12-month, $300 free trial

Need billing for free tier:
You have enabled billing for your account through the Google Cloud Platform Console.

The 12-month, $300 free trial starts automatically when you set up your first billing account.
You must provide credit card or bank details to set up a billing account and verify your identity, but you won't be charged during the free trial.

Your free trial ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met:

12 months have elapsed since you signed up.
You've spent the $300 in credit.
Your remaining credit and days are displayed at the top of the Google Cloud Platform Console during your free trial period.

Even though you set up a billing account, you aren't charged unless you upgrade to a paid account

No credit card?
If you don't have a credit card, you can provide your bank account information instead, and if you opt to provide your bank account information:

Google deposits a random fraction of a $1.00 USD dollar into your account, which might take 2 or 3 days.
You use the deposited amount to finish the sign-up process.
